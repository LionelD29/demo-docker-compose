# Demo Docker Compose
Demo of Docker Compose with a tiny Angular + Spring boot application

Run the command 'docker-compose up --build' at root to build up and start the application

It runs on http://localhost:1080 and communicates with the back-end at http://localhost:8081

To stop the app, press CTRL + C inside the terminal where you ran 'docker-compose up --build', then 'docker-compose down',
or simply 'docker-compose down' in another terminal at the root of the project
